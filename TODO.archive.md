### TOOLSET-004 — Reduce fragmented Autowork handoffs and misleading zero-progress reports

- Status: done (local implementation and focused contract tests; not a live throughput claim).
- Goal: Complete connected accepted outcomes with fewer redundant preparation/review cycles.
- Sources: [delivery batch contract](skills/autowork/references/delivery-batches.md),
  [worker body generation](skills/autowork/scripts/start_goal.py), [cron prompts](scripts/wire-owner-cron.py).
- Scope delivered: Coherent-batch guidance, worker/cron prompt propagation, portable
  coordinator guidance and delivery-first reporting with truthful parent status.
- Acceptance checked: Generated worker text retains the explicit scope/exclusions,
  directs completion of every admitted consumer, and retains independent review;
  generated cron text includes batching, evidence reuse limits and parent reporting.
- Checks: Worker role contracts (5 tests) and cron prompt tests (15 tests) passed.
- Remaining qualification: Real model batching and reduced elapsed time are unverified;
  TOOLSET-003 still owns live bounded recovery qualification.
- Dependencies: None.
- Owner: Current repository change; no claim on any product worker or schedule.

### TOOLSET-005 — Recover registration context across filtered terminal environments

- Status: done (local helper regression; live worker recovery not yet verified).
- Goal: Prevent a missing terminal environment field from holding a correctly registered task.
- Source: [workspace guard](skills/autowork/scripts/pass_workspace.py).
- Scope delivered: Exact original-handoff recovery for registration only; no environment
  forgery, registry mutation, candidate repinning or native ownership bypass.
- Checks: 22 workspace tests pass, including missing, stale, wrong-task, wrong-card
  and conflicting handoffs plus conflicting inherited context.
- Remaining qualification: Existing workers retain their original admitted contracts;
  they need same-card reconciliation before using a changed helper.

### TOOLSET-006 — Preserve review progress and direct coordinator closeout

- Status: done (local regression coverage; autonomous model follow-through unverified).
- Goal: Keep new review outcomes visible and direct completed cards to integration checks.
- Source: [reconciliation helper](skills/autowork/scripts/reconcile.py).
- Scope delivered: Report-cache identity includes run and outcome; phase-specific next
  actions distinguish active/queued cards, recovery and terminal closeout.
- Checks: 12 reconciliation tests pass; terminal hints never claim delivery or approval.
- Remaining qualification: A model must execute the advised closeout; the read-only
  helper itself does not merge, dispatch, authenticate liveness or resume jobs.

- [x] TOOLSET-010 — Bind Telegram reports and setup confirmation independently of invocation
  - Status: done (source instructions, offline contract checks and independent scenario review).
  - Goal: CRON-REPORTING — Resolve Telegram reporting independently of the invoking surface.
  - Sources: User request to report in Telegram from any invocation surface;
    [native workflow](skills/cron-autowork/SKILL.md),
    [portable workflow](adapters/skills/cron-autowork/SKILL.md),
    [workflow documentation](docs/workflows.md).
  - Scope delivered: Explicit profile/chat/topic routing, one setup confirmation,
    nonempty per-occurrence reports, delivery receipt checks and truthful failure reporting.
  - Exclusions: No live profile/job changes, unrequested immediate execution,
    cross-profile messaging, push, deployment or real-device operations.
  - Acceptance checked: Guidance covers CLI and Telegram topic setup, explicit local/quiet
    preferences, existing-job repair, missing transports and queued/ambiguous delivery.
    Setup confirmation remains distinct from scheduled execution and message delivery.
  - Checks: `uv run --python 3.12 --no-project --with-requirements requirements-test.txt python -m unittest discover -s tests`
    passed: 246 tests run, two skipped; five cron contract tests passed. Independent
    before/after scenario review approved the source changes. Markdown links and diff checks passed.
  - Remaining qualification: Instructions and fixtures do not prove live agent behavior;
    TOOLSET-011 owns installation and Telegram receipt verification on the affected host.
  - Dependencies: None.
  - Ownership: Current Autowork coordinator for local closeout; no live worker claim.

Closeout repair for TOOLSET-010: task-source links to archive policies and test
code were incorrectly treated as history destinations, blocking this move.
Owner discovery now uses navigation outside task bodies; default/custom-owner
regression cases reproduce the failure and pass after the fix. All 36 archive,
policy and redaction tests passed, with independent preservation review.
Combined closeout validation: `uv run --python 3.12 --no-project
--with-requirements requirements-test.txt python scripts/check.py` passed
(803 tests run, two skipped; eight live/native modules excluded).
Existing open bodies and prior archive bytes were preserved; the completed
entry appears exactly once and a repeated render was byte-stable.

### TOOLSET-009 — Account for archival in the shared rendering contract

- Task: TOOLSET-009 — Account for archival in the shared rendering contract
- Status: done (source contract acceptance and offline preservation checks).
- Priority: Medium; independent of TOOLSET-008.
- Goal: ARCHIVAL — Agents review and deliver every artifact changed by a render operation.
- Sources: [engineering cycle](skills/shared/ENGINEERING-CYCLE.md),
  [renderer](skills/docs-sync/scripts/goals.py),
  [archive contract](skills/docs-sync/references/todo-archive.md),
  [archive regression tests](skills/docs-sync/scripts/test_todo_archive.py).
- Evidence: Commit `08701bd` now describes coverage rendering, automatic archival
  and readback of TODO plus the selected archive in ENGINEERING-CYCLE.md.
  The original user's planning request adopted the earlier drift finding.
  This pass does not reopen that implemented wording correction or claim that
  its complete acceptance criteria have been reviewed by the integration owner.
- Scope: Correct the shared cycle's render description and closeout sequence.
  Require readback/diff review of TODO.md and the actual archive selected by the
  helper; include attributable archive changes in the handoff and any separately
  authorized commit. Reuse the existing archive contract and regression coverage.
- Exclusions: No renderer behavior change, archive rename, mass task migration,
  unrelated contract rewrite, implementation during planning, or implied commit.
- Acceptance: The contract states both coverage rendering and automatic archival;
  it requires post-render verification of preserved open bodies, complete archived
  bodies, valid links and byte stability on an unchanged second pass. When an
  existing archive has a custom path, verification uses that path. No claim that
  instruction tests prove model adherence or live completion.
- Checks: From skills/docs-sync/scripts, run
  `python3 -m unittest test_todo_archive`; check changed Markdown links and
  `git diff --check`. Review the final wording against render/archive_tasks.
  This pass ran test_todo_archive, test_archive_policy, test_render_safety,
  test_goals and test_handoff_reconciliation: 74 tests passed. Canonical local
  links, archive-prefix preservation and unchanged second-render bytes passed.
  These checks do not establish model adherence or replace acceptance review.
- Dependencies: None; the archival implementation and regression tests are now
  included with the archive changes. No dependency on TOOLSET-008.
- Ownership: Next authorized implementer; no active claim or implementation authority
  is created by this planning pass.
- Next action: Review the landed wording against all acceptance criteria; make only
  evidenced remaining corrections, then reconcile this same task's completion.
- Closeout: Reviewed every acceptance criterion against the shared cycle, Docs Sync
  and render/archive_tasks. Added explicit open/closed-body preservation, actual
  custom archive path, links, unchanged second-pass bytes and handoff/commit checks.
  Removed Docs Sync's contradictory claim that rendering never changes task bodies.
- Verification: `cd skills/docs-sync/scripts && python3 -m unittest test_todo_archive test_archive_policy test_render_safety`
  passed (31 tests); changed Markdown links and diff checks passed. Independent
  acceptance review approved both contract corrections. No model/live qualification claimed.
- Closure normalization: The duplicate checkbox title is retained as a Task field;
  the heading and explicit Status own this completed entry's archival boundary.

### TOOLSET-001 — Align portable skill discovery with the current public workflows

- [x] TOOLSET-001 — Align portable skill discovery with the current public workflows
- Status: done; independent review approved `5e5d043`, integrated locally at `af8e567`.
- Goal: PORTABLE — Consistent primary workflow names across Hermes, Codex and Pi.
- Sources: [accepted scope](docs/project.md#accepted-requirements), [public workflow mapping](docs/workflows.md), [portable adapters](adapters/skills/COMMON.md), [Pi registration](adapters/pi.mjs).
- Evidence: Hermes folds Grill Me into Plan With Me and publishes Plan For Me;
  the portable package still discovers separate Grill Me and Autoresearch skills;
  Hermes now also registers Autoresearch separately from Plan For Me.
- Scope: Align portable public discovery and challenge/research routing; update
  host-specific examples and registration tests. Preserve non-planning protocols
  and supported compatibility invocations.
- Exclusions: No Hermes Agent edits, permission changes or removal of user skills.
- Acceptance: Canonical skills are discoverable on each host; challenge mode and
  every research protocol resolve to valid instructions without recursive routing.
  Package references remain valid after installation.
- Checks: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_portable_package.py`;
  `node --test tests/portable_pi.test.mjs`; native installation/discovery in temporary homes.
- Dependencies: None.
- Ownership: Original Autowork worker and independent reviewer completed the local
  slice; the current coordinator verified and integrated it. No live claim remains.
- Completion evidence: `5e5d043b758c63592bade98eae04d3670e1e2376` contains the nine
  reviewed implementation/test/document paths; `af8e56723e2c3c10f7068bba06cbbed23ef246b8`
  integrates them while preserving the earlier documentation work.
  Integration checks: portable Python regressions (3 tests), Pi Node regressions
  (3 tests), `uv run --python 3.12 --no-project --with-requirements requirements-test.txt python scripts/check.py`
  (247 + 427 + 122 + 8 tests, all four directories passed; eight live/native modules
  excluded), local Markdown links/anchors and `git diff --cached --check` passed.
  Exact-source independent review also verified native Codex 0.162.1 and Pi 1.2.0
  discovery in isolated credential-free homes. Model compliance, Telegram delivery,
  unattended execution and minimum supported versions remain NOT_CHECKED.

<!-- TOOLSET-002 local integration -->

### TOOLSET-002 — Provide a supported first-time task-index initialization path

- [x] TOOLSET-002 — Provide a supported first-time task-index initialization path
- Status: done; reviewed commit 7f07b182 integrated into local main at 73a8efc.
- Completion evidence: Independent same-card review approved the exact implementation;
  the composed integration candidate passed all four offline directories (247/437/135/8
  tests, two skipped). Empty/TODO-only initialization, conflict preservation and
  repeat-byte stability are covered. Live model/native/Telegram qualification is excluded.
- Goal: BACKLOG — Let Docs Sync bootstrap a native-consumable backlog without manual JSON edits.
- Sources: [accepted scope](docs/project.md#accepted-requirements), [goals helper](skills/docs-sync/scripts/goals.py), [document scaffold](skills/docs-sync/references/document-scaffold.md), [project contract](docs/project.md).
- Evidence: The CLI documents command-only ledger mutation but exposes no init or
  add-goal command. Docs Sync can seed the documented JSON schema and run fmt;
  this pass initializes this repository's index without implementing a CLI entry point.
- Scope: Establish and document a supported bootstrap operation; preserve full task
  bodies and existing IDs, then validate/render a machine index for this queue.
- Exclusions: No invented accepted plans, completion evidence or overwrite of an
  existing ledger; do not launch workers as part of document initialization.
- Acceptance: Empty-repository bootstrap and an existing TODO-only repository have
  reproducible coverage; repeated initialization preserves bytes; existing/conflicting
  state is preserved; generated task/body links pass consumer checks.
- Checks: Extend goals-helper fixture tests; run `python3 scripts/check.py` and the
  supported validator/render idempotency checks on the generated queue.
- Dependencies: None.
- Ownership: Original worker and independent reviewer finished the local candidate;
  canonical integration and closure remain with its coordinator. Do not redispatch.

- [x] TOOLSET-012 — Start ready tasks through one composed default preflight
- Status: done; independent review approved fef4241; integrated locally as e2a0838.
- Goal: STARTUP — Reach useful implementation sooner with less preparation/chat.
- Sources: [accepted full contract](docs/project.md#faster-ready-task-startup), [coordinator](skills/autowork/scripts/owner_cycle.py), [admission](skills/autowork/scripts/start_goal.py), [source capture](skills/autowork/scripts/source_freshness.py), [Autowork](skills/autowork/SKILL.md), [engineering adapter](skills/engineering/SKILL.md), [router](skills/engineering/scripts/route.py).
- Evidence: Composed owner_cycle ready preflight and concise contracts are implemented and independently reviewed. Integration e2a0838 passed the full offline check inventory (252/448/135/8 tests; 2 skipped; 8 live/integration modules excluded). Native timing remains TOOLSET-013.
- Scope: Finish one default ready-task command: reconcile → select/read body → capture sources → generate short complete contract → real native handoff → bookkeeping. Keep routing references optional, phase bundles optional, and workflow authority in Autowork. Use existing helpers/tests; preserve upstream protocol bytes.
- Acceptance: No separate validate-only call, planner, docs audit, full suite or optional skill load before normal dispatch. Preserve required contract fields, immutable base, canonical authority, freshness, ownership, budgets and original startup guard. Stale, held, incomplete, interrupted and already-owned cases fail/recover safely without replacement cards. Compact reports expose failures. Exact-one protocol selection and phase compatibility retain unknown-name/tamper refusal, mandatory tests and independent review; protocols never expand authority.
- Checks: From skills/autowork/scripts run `python3 -m unittest test_owner_cycle test_goal_handoff test_source_freshness test_response_tail`. At root run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_engineering_vendor.py`, `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_workflow_cycle.py`, and `uv run --python 3.12 --no-project --with-requirements requirements-test.txt python scripts/check.py`; check affected links and `git diff --check`. Reuse partial-delivery checks only when their inputs still match.
- Exclusions: No speculative cache acceptance, weaker guards/review, writer takeover, new scheduler/parallelism, upstream Agent/model/provider changes, push/deployment or live job edits.
- Dependencies: None.
- Ownership: Existing native worker and original coordinator; preserve its card, pinned inputs, scope and consumed budget. This wording change grants no new authority.
- Next action: TOOLSET-013 paired native measurement after its enforced environment limits are established; offline implementation does not qualify measured savings.


<!-- archived from TODO.md: TOOLSET-014 residue reconciliation -->

Source section: Next

The empty heading below was left live by the earlier checkbox-only move.
Its exact matching completed checkbox and full evidence body are already above
in this archive, with Status: done, review fef4241 and integration e2a0838;
goals.json also records TOOLSET-012 as done. Preserve that existing body unchanged.
This reconciliation adds no completion or native measurement claim.

### TOOLSET-014 — Archive completed task headings with their checkbox bodies

- [x] TOOLSET-014 — Archive completed task headings with their checkbox bodies
- Status: done; reviewed 218865cc530bf9fb2711bce984e9af4b1a6e4f77 and integrated locally.
- Completion evidence: Original worker and native same-card reviewer passed 48 focused tests. Coordinator reran Python 3.12 scripts/check.py on the exact reviewed commit: 253/448/139/8 tests across four offline directories passed; two skipped and eight live/native/integration modules excluded. Complete-unit CLI conservation and archive/render idempotency verified; no live qualification or publication.
- Goal: ARCHIVAL — Keep complete closed units in history without empty live task headings.
- Sources: [accepted scope](docs/project.md#accepted-requirements), [archive implementation](skills/docs-sync/scripts/todo_archive.py), [archive regressions](skills/docs-sync/scripts/test_todo_archive.py), [archive contract](skills/docs-sync/references/todo-archive.md).
- Scope: Correct matching heading-plus-checkbox archival boundaries; add CLI regression coverage and reconcile the existing empty TOOLSET-012 heading only against exact archived completion evidence. Preserve open tasks, ambiguous/conflicting units, nested evidence, CRLF and lossless history.
- Current evidence: prepare() on a ledger-done T1 with matching heading and closed checkbox moves the checkbox body but retains the empty T1 heading and reports T1 retained. Canonical TOOLSET-012 exhibits that residue.
- Decision: Fix the complete unit boundary, not a blanket heading cleanup; agent maintenance decision under broad repository authority, not a new user priority.
- Acceptance: A matching completed heading and checkbox archive together exactly once; open/conflicting/ambiguous bodies remain unchanged; second archive/render is byte-stable. Existing history is not rewritten and no live acceptance is claimed.
- Checks: Run test_todo_archive, test_archive_policy, test_render_safety and test_backlog_recovery from skills/docs-sync/scripts, then the safe offline scripts/check.py inventory with the documented Python 3.12 dependencies; validate ledger, links and diff. Required native review remains separate.
- Exclusions: No jobs/profile edits, native/model smoke, remote publication, upstream edits, history rewriting or completion inference from an empty heading.
- Dependencies: None.
- Ownership: Next authorized isolated worker; canonical integration stays coordinator-owned.
- Next action: Reproduce the failing full-unit CLI case, repair boundaries, verify and request review on the same bounded card.

### TOOLSET-015 — Preserve explicit source refs in behind-only realignment

- [x] TOOLSET-015 — Preserve explicit source refs in behind-only realignment
- Status: done; minimal source-default repair committed at 16a750ce8aaea2ed914606edf4b97770a1fc85d3 and independently approved on the original native card. Coordinator integration candidate passed the Python 3.12 offline inventory (263/448/139/8 tests; 2 skipped; 8 native/model/integration modules excluded). Seven real-Git regressions, Bash syntax and whitespace checks passed. Local integration only; TOOLSET-003 remains unqualified.
- Goal: RECOVERY — Keep authorized local recovery usable without weakening preservation checks.
- Sources: [accepted recovery scope](docs/project.md#accepted-requirements), [realignment helper](skills/git-pull-merge/scripts/behind-only-realign.sh), [delivery safeguards](skills/git-pull-merge/SKILL.md).
- Scope: Repair explicit source-ref parsing in the behind-only helper and add disposable real-Git regression coverage. Own the helper and a focused test in tests/; preserve all existing ancestry, staged-index, safety-ref and writer-byte safeguards.
- Current evidence: Bash expands `SRC=${1:-@{u}}` with a supplied argument into that argument plus a literal `}`; an explicit immutable commit therefore fails before realignment.
- Decision: Fix the bounded parser defect under existing recovery authority; do not replace the realignment algorithm or reinterpret its exclusions.
- Acceptance: Explicit full commit and named-ref inputs resolve exactly; omitted input still resolves the configured upstream. Successful behind-only runs preserve dirty tracked and untracked bytes. Diverged history and staged changes still refuse without moving HEAD or altering bytes.
- Checks: Add and run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_behind_only_realign.py`; run `bash -n skills/git-pull-merge/scripts/behind-only-realign.sh` and `git diff --check`. Use disposable repositories only; independent native review and scoped local commit are required before closure.
- Exclusions: No canonical realignment test, remote publication, live profiles/jobs, upstream Hermes edits, safety bypass, unrelated refactoring or native/model qualification claim.
- Dependencies: None.
- Ownership: Next authorized toolset worker; no overlapping live claim observed at booking.
- Next action: Reproduce with disposable Git, repair parsing, verify success/refusal and request review. TOOLSET-003 retains its bounded native-environment prerequisite.
