# Work queue

[Completed tasks](TODO.archive.md)


Central queue for Hermes Toolset. Scope and current architecture: [project contract](docs/project.md).
[goals.json](goals.json) indexes the remaining work below; verified completed
tasks move to the archive automatically. Ledger eligibility is not worker
admission or live qualification.

TOOLSET-002's reviewed first-index initialization is integrated locally;
TOOLSET-003 remains the isolated live-recovery qualification. TOOLSET-001 and
TOOLSET-002 completion evidence is in [the archive](TODO.archive.md).
Fast-startup plan: TOOLSET-012 is reviewed and integrated locally; TOOLSET-013
retains measured native startup qualification. TOOLSET-003/011 still need their
named environments; TOOLSET-008's reviewed continuation correction is integrated
and archived. Priority plan: TOOLSET-028 (archived) enforces TODO.md order offline; TOOLSET-029 is the
separately authorized fleet migration. Preserve caller limits, queue priorities and ownership.

Execution notes: Each task states the remaining action, acceptance, checks and stop
conditions. Read linked detail only for a concrete gap; do not re-plan settled work
or redo verified partial delivery. Reuse check evidence only while source, tests,
dependencies and environment match. Required tests, review, ownership protections,
integrity checks and live qualification remain mandatory. Editing this queue does
not change a running worker's assigned contract or authorize dispatch/scheduling.

### TOOLSET-024 — Reject malformed goal source fields before task selection

- [ ] TOOLSET-024 — Reject malformed goal source fields before task selection
- Status: open; malformed non-string source reproduced as valid and eligible.
- Goal: BACKLOG — Keep accepted-source identity structurally trustworthy for backlog consumers.
- Sources: [accepted scope](docs/project.md#accepted-requirements), [task-index contract](docs/project.md#interface-and-state-contract), [validator](skills/docs-sync/scripts/goals.py), [regressions](skills/docs-sync/scripts/test_goals.py).
- Scope: Reject non-string goal source fields in the existing ledger shape validator and add focused offline API/CLI regressions. Preserve supported string sources and additional metadata; document the diagnostic if needed.
- Acceptance: Object, list, Boolean and numeric source fields cannot validate, normalize or yield eligible tasks. Diagnostics identify the affected goal field without leaking supplied values or traceback. Existing valid string sources, version checks and duplicate-key refusals remain passing. Refused CLI mutations leave ledger/TODO bytes unchanged.
- Checks: `uv run --python 3.12 --no-project --with-requirements requirements-test.txt python -m unittest discover -s skills/docs-sync/scripts -p test_goals.py`; repeat for test_milestone_focus.py and test_goal_concurrency.py; `git diff --check`. Independently review the exact candidate before coordinator local integration.
- Dependencies: None.
- Ownership: toolset coordinator and one isolated native worker; coordinator owns canonical ledger and integration.
- Exclusions: No upstream edits, deployment, publication, profile/job/settings changes, live/model qualification, acceptance weakening or foreign edits.
- Decision: Use the existing shape validator, not new path-format policy. This is a routine agent decision under authorized repository maintenance, not historical user approval. Current reproduction: a nonempty object source returns no shape/semantic errors and an eligible task despite the source-heading contract.
- Next action: Add a failing malformed-source regression, implement the smallest validator correction, run the named offline suites and return an owned local commit for independent review.

### TOOLSET-029 — Migrate fleet repositories to recorded TODO.md priority order

- [ ] TOOLSET-029 — Migrate fleet repositories to recorded TODO.md priority order
- Status: open.
- Historical migration receipt: partial (2026-10-14): 6 of 9 migrated and committed locally with unchanged eligible order: hermes-toolset, sierra, landing-golf, india, juliet and golf (the last four after a separate checkpoint commit of their pending queue edits). Not migrated: charlie (a staged 9-file docs batch includes the queue files), bravo (live in-progress claim and active session) and kilo (no commits). All matching jobs were already paused and stay paused.
- Goal: PRIORITY — Make TODO.md order the enforced human priority.
- Sources: [accepted priority plan](docs/project.md#todo-owned-task-priority), [accepted rollout](docs/project.md#rollout), [bootstrap contract](docs/project.md#reconciliation-and-bootstrap).
- Scope: For each fleet repository with goals.json: dry-run bootstrap and report the full before/after order (including bravo's deeper difference), preserve stopped/paused jobs, lock and verify unchanged inputs, migrate, validate, compare the next pick before and after, and commit locally per repository within the existing migration authority. The later stop-all instruction supersedes automatic resumption.
- Acceptance: Every repository has a synchronized `priority_order`; first eligible picks are unchanged; matching repositories get no TODO.md rewrite; a failed repository stays paused; a later manual reorder changes selection after reconciliation.
- Checks: Per-repository dry-run receipts, `goals.py validate` and `goals.py next --json` before and after, and job readback confirming stopped/paused state is unchanged.
- Dependencies: TOOLSET-028.
- Ownership: Toolset coordinator under separate live authorization.
- Exclusions: No push, no unrelated job changes and no job resumption while the owner's stop-all instruction remains in force.
- Next action: Recheck the remaining repositories' current staged/unstaged changes, actual writers, initial commit and recorded priority state. Re-run the dry-run with a fresh revision for any now-eligible repository; preserve current pauses and genuinely overlapping work. Prior receipt conditions are not permanent holds.

### TOOLSET-003 — Qualify automatic planning recovery with a real bounded workflow

- [ ] TOOLSET-003 — Qualify automatic planning recovery with a real bounded workflow
- Status: open; live qualification not run.
- Goal: RECOVERY — Prove recovery reaches execution, not just a planning receipt.
- Sources: [accepted scope](docs/project.md#accepted-requirements), [recovery contract](skills/autowork/references/backlog-planning.md), [existing regressions](skills/autowork/scripts/test_backlog_plan.py), [verification limits](docs/testing.md).
- Scope: In a disposable repository, reproduce missing prerequisites and candidate drift. Observe automatic planning, TODO update and retry of the eligible original slice; repeat unchanged inputs once to verify decision reuse.
- Acceptance: No extra user planner command; original exclusions and ownership survive; execution is reported separately from planning.
- Checks: Run focused recovery regressions and one bounded isolated model/native smoke journey covering both cases. Retain exact source, task, commands/results, commit or none, and remaining blocker. Offline tests alone cannot close this task.
- Exclusions: No production messages/deployment, real user repositories, forbidden prerequisite commits, writer takeover or fabricated completion.
- Dependencies: None.
- Environment prerequisite: Configured isolated model/native environment.
- Ownership: Next authorized coordinator; no active claim recorded.
- Current evidence: The shipped containment backend admits only local fixture executables and explicitly excludes provider/network dispatch. Its synthetic spending controller is not a model spending limit. No qualifying model journey was run.
- Next action: Supply an isolated model endpoint with externally enforced spend and descendant limits, then execute the bounded recovery journey; existing offline fixtures cannot replace it.

### TOOLSET-019 — Deploy reviewed local fixes to selected eligible profiles

- [ ] TOOLSET-019 — Deploy reviewed local fixes to selected eligible profiles
- Status: in_progress; reviewed scoped local updater is implemented and integrated in eb72be6; selected-profile deployment remains pending.
- Goal: RECOVERY — Deliver reviewed repairs without remote fetches or fleet-wide side effects.
- Sources: [accepted recovery plan](docs/project.md#end-to-end-original-task-recovery), [updater](update_bundle.py), [updater tests](tests/test_update_bundle.py), [installation](docs/installation.md).
- Scope: Extend the existing updater with explicit selected profiles and immutable reviewed local source, native security admission, preflight/staging/backups, installed hash readback and resumable per-profile results. Preserve unselected consumers of shared sources and pinned runtimes.
- Acceptance: No implicit fetch, profile expansion, scan override, worker restart or configuration/schedule change. Active affected consumers defer; independent eligible targets proceed. Drift/source races refuse before unsafe writes. Retry reuses the same source and backups, unchanged deployment is a no-op, and installed bytes/registrations are verified without claiming product recovery.
- Checks: 52 real-Git/fake-native updater fixtures passed. Independent review found shared-board ownership and interrupted-clone defects; both reproduced and passed after repair. The combined 318/470/139/8 offline gate passed. Native scoped preflight ran; installation and live registration remain unverified.
- Dependencies: None.
- Ownership: Shared maintainer for implementation; authorized coordinator for selected-profile deployment.
- Exclusions: No implicit remote publication, dependency overrides, native scanner bypass, global configuration changes or active-runtime rebinding.
- Historical deployment evidence: Preflight against 51d99d6 deferred three selected profiles under the former native-ownership checks and one for a customized `skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md`; their bytes were preserved. That receipt proves no installation. The TODO-first implementation has since retired card-only vetoes; recheck actual consumers and current customizations rather than treating those old deferrals as present blockers.
- Next action: Check actual process identity, workspace writers and live helper consumers, then reconcile customized skill drift before scoped installation. Historical cards require no release or reconciliation. Reuse the reviewed updater; do not repeat its completed implementation or label preflight as deployment.

- [ ] TOOLSET-011 — Qualify the updated reporting workflow on the affected profile
- Status: open; original target environment unavailable.
- Goal: CRON-REPORTING — Verify setup confirmation and scheduled Telegram delivery separately.
- Sources: [accepted reporting qualification](docs/workflows.md#telegram-reporting-qualification), [reporting contract](skills/cron-autowork/SKILL.md), [verification boundaries](docs/workflows.md), archived TOOLSET-010 source delivery.
- Scope: On the original host/profile, install the updated bundle through its supported path. Identify the existing job, preserve its state/scope, verify its requested Telegram route, then inspect the next scheduled result.
- Acceptance: A setup request from another surface confirms once in the intended chat/topic; a scheduled occurrence has attributable execution and Telegram message receipts. Report failed, queued or unverified delivery honestly.
- Checks: Read back installed source and saved route/state; verify the actual setup message and scheduled result/delivery. These live checks are not run.
- Exclusions: No duplicate job, implicit resume, immediate development run, budget reset, push/deployment, USB formatting or real-PC changes. Never substitute another profile.
- Dependencies: TOOLSET-010.
- Environment prerequisite: Original host, affected profile/job and authorized Telegram transport.
- Ownership: Coordinator with that access; no active claim.
- Current evidence: Exact original profile directory and original job ID are absent from this host's root and existing-profile job stores. No replacement job, profile or message was created.
- Next action: Restore access to the original host/profile/job and its authorized Telegram route, then inspect the setup and scheduled delivery receipts.


### TOOLSET-013 — Measure time to useful worker action and qualify the faster startup

- [ ] TOOLSET-013 — Measure time to useful worker action and qualify the faster startup
- Status: open; TOOLSET-012 is integrated; isolated bounded environment still required.
- Goal: STARTUP — Verify lower preparation overhead without weaker startup safety.
- Sources: [accepted measurement contract](docs/project.md#faster-ready-task-startup), TOOLSET-012, [admission](skills/autowork/scripts/start_goal.py), [reporting boundaries](skills/autowork/references/dispatch-and-reporting.md).
- Scope: Compare manual and composed startup on the same disposable accepted task, source, model/environment and cold/warm conditions. Separate request-to-handoff, queue wait, admission and first useful test/reproduction/edit after the guard. Count coordinator tool/model round trips and routine messages.
- Acceptance: Fewer preparation round trips/messages with no observed comparable startup regression; preserve stale/ownership/dependency refusals. A heartbeat/queued card is not useful action; offline fixtures cannot close native qualification. Investigate contradictory timing.
- Checks: Run both routes with source-bound implementation commands; retain exact argv, dependency/interpreter/model identity, enforced limits, timestamps, native admission/run evidence and failures. Harness/baseline runs are not yet executed.
- Exclusions: No production repositories/messages, fabricated measurements, absolute latency/minimum-version promises, budget reset, protection bypass, push/deployment or live schedule/profile edits.
- Dependencies: TOOLSET-012.
- Environment prerequisite: Isolated configured native/model environment with external spending/descendant limits; unknown usage is not zero.
- Ownership: Authorized coordinator with that environment; no active claim.
- Current evidence: No externally capped isolated model environment is established; the existing local containment/controller fixtures exclude provider execution. No useful-action timing or speed claim was inferred from them.
- Next action: With the same isolated model environment required by TOOLSET-003, execute the paired cold/warm comparison and report actual results.

### TOOLSET-032 — Define repository-type role profiles in the Docs Sync scaffold

- [ ] TOOLSET-032 — Define repository-type role profiles in the Docs Sync scaffold
- Status: open
- Goal: DOCS-COMPLETENESS — Make role applicability consistent per repository type and cover user-facing reference roles.
- Sources: [accepted completeness plan](docs/project.md#checkable-core-document-completeness), [document scaffold](skills/docs-sync/references/document-scaffold.md), [Docs Sync core owners](skills/docs-sync/SKILL.md).
- Scope: Define service, library, CLI/plugin, application and infrastructure profiles with baseline roles in the scaffold. Add reference (commands/configuration), glossary, troubleshooting and installation/upgrade roles with ownership boundaries. The manifest records the selected profile and `docs.py check` uses that profile's baseline. Keep the portable adapter skill aligned.
- Acceptance: Each profile lists its baseline roles; a CLI/plugin manifest missing a reference role fails `check` while a service manifest without one does not; manifests without a profile keep the current baseline. No empty documents are required.
- Checks: Profile regressions in the docs-sync test directory; portable package/adapter tests already in `python3 scripts/check.py`; `git diff --check`.
- Dependencies: TOOLSET-030.
- Ownership: Toolset coordinator under Autowork local repository authority.
- Exclusions: No consumer-repository migration, document generation or push.
- Next action: Add the profile table and its check regressions.
