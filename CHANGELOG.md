# Changelog

Notable implemented changes. Commit references identify source history, not a
claim of a tagged release, completed installation or live workflow qualification.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Native Codex marketplace/plugin packaging and a Pi package with portable workflow
  adapters and package checks (`bcb72c5`).
- Adaptive document-role scaffold for Docs Sync (`a16b754`).
- Verification of explicitly declared writer-registration prerequisites (`d422ea4`).

### Changed

- Hermes skill discovery publishes Plan With Me, Plan For Me and Docs Sync;
  previous command spellings remain compatibility aliases (`bcb72c5`).
- Grill Me becomes a challenge mode in the Hermes plugin catalog; portable
  catalog alignment remains tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md) (`bcb72c5`).
- Autowork routes stalled preparation to bounded planning, persists findings and
  retries execution within existing authority (`bcb72c5`). This is a workflow
  contract and tested helper behavior, not proof of live task completion.
- Local coordination and workflow references use current Autowork authority and
  names (`2377918`).
